<h1>My fun "do whatever" project</h1>

<p>Here I do alot of trial and error to expand my skills
 ...and deploy it to sivert.me </p>

<p>It uses react, bootstrap, webpack <br/>
It requires node.js and npm <br/>
npm start //to start the local server, duh <br/>
npm run-script build //to create a dist to deploy
</p>
